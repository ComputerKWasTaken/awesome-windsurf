# Welcome to My Windsurf Rules

In this folder, I share some rules that I love to use for my Windsurf projects. You'll notice that I have two directories to match the official Windsurf terminology.

- `memories/SchneiderSam/Global-AI-rules`: These are the rules that will be applied to Cascade in all workspaces.
- `memories/SchneiderSam/Workspace-AI-rules`: These are the rules that will be applied to Cascade in the current workspace.

In each path, you'll find different rules tailored to enhance your experience and maintain consistency across projects. 

Feel free to explore, have fun, and I am open to any suggestions you might have!

Happy Windsurfing!

## Why And How I Use Global Rules

Global rules are essential for maintaining consistency and clarity across my projects. By establishing a set of guidelines that apply universally, I ensure that all code adheres to the same standards, making it easier to read, maintain, and collaborate with others. These rules help in avoiding common pitfalls and encourage best practices, ultimately leading to higher quality code and more efficient development processes.

I love consistent commit messages, and sometimes I write in German; I know I have to be consistent and learn to write only in English, but hey, I am learning, and sometimes Windsurf outputs the commit messages in German, so with these global rules, it works really well.

Just follow [this documentation](https://docs.codeium.com/windsurf/memories) and copy these rules to your own Windsurf environment.
