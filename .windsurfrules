1. Whenever we make a new commit, we should update CHANGELOG.md. Same for merge/pull requests that happen on remote.
2. This is a public repository, so please be respectful of others and make sure the content makes sense to others.
3. We have access to the Github CLI via the gh command. We are already authenticated.
4. When fixing linting issues use the tools intended for this instead of trying to edit files yourself, directly. You can see which tools we have in package.json.
5. When committing, put quotes around your commit message. Also, it's a good practice to format commit messages with a type, scope (optional), and description. The correct format should be: type(scope): description
