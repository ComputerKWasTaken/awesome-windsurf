### Common issues from the community

| Issue | Description | Solution |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Special Characters in Chat | Special characters (like ANSI escape codes) can break the chat interface | Use this [custom Jest reporter](https://gist.github.com/BryceEWatson/79ce7138bb4edb0a5ab6104cf1f6f72a) to clean and format test output for chat compatibility |
| Chat Response Issues | Chat might become unresponsive or timeout | 1. Start a new chat session<br>2. Switch to Cascade Base<br>3. If problems persist, restart Windsurf and hope for the best|
| Windsurf Rules Files | Rules don't appear to be honored | 1. Ensure your rules files are not more than 6k chars<br>2. Do not put any references to files in the rules files that would total more than 6k combined<br>3. See [Cascade Documentation](https://docs.codeium.com/windsurf/cascade#memories) for more details on rules |
| Allowed Commands | Commands in your allow list still prompt to be accepted | 1. This currently seems to be related to rules files bloating<br>2. See solutions for rules files above |
| Credit System & Downtime | Credits may be consumed during service interruptions or failed flows | Currently no built-in way to track or reimburse lost credits. Consider:<br>1. Document failed flows with timestamps<br>2. Contact support for significant issues<br>3. Request status page or real-time service health indicators |
